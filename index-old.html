By utilizing cutting-edge technologies and techniques to prove trustworthiness in the underlying systems, the CertiK Foundation aims to raise the standards of security and trustworthiness in the blockchain. Founded by acclaimed computer science professors, the CertiK Foundation has leveraged its team’s breakthrough research to build the world’s premier, security-first blockchain, which relies on a native digital utility fuel, CTK. The CertiK Foundation has supported the development of a robust suite of technologies and tools to ensure that security and correctness are maintained throughout every phase of the blockchain lifecycle, from initial development to live usage.</p><p id="74dbe10e-eae2-4437-ae99-b5c6285dbec5" class="">The CertiK ecosystem is envisaged to provide end-to-end security solutions for blockchains, decentralized applications, and other mission-critical software applications. While the components of the CertiK ecosystem integrate natively with CertiK Chain, the CertiK Foundation believes in cross-collaborative bridges with other blockchains, as security should not be a choice, but a necessity. With breakthrough technologies and techniques for proving security and correctness, the CertiK Foundation aims to provide the infrastructure of provable trust for all.</p><figure id="bbfe2ad7-d408-464e-abb5-40d53cdadf38" class="image"><a href="CertiKChain%20Whitepaper%20bbfe2ad7d408464eabb540d53cdadf38/Comp_1_1.gif"><img style="width:672px" src="CertiKChain%20Whitepaper%20bbfe2ad7d408464eabb540d53cdadf38/Comp_1_1.gif"/></a></figure><h1 id="534d6c58-2f85-4b37-b88e-24952b5dd5a1" class="">1 <strong>Introduction</strong></h1><p id="0ace9524-5e47-4259-b620-e37ff1eb71cc" class="">Since the advent of Satoshi Nakamoto’s peer-to-peer electronic cash system, called <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin</a>, the digital world has seen a slew of innovations pushing forward a <a href="https://ethereum.org/">trustless</a>, decentralized alternative to today’s centralized world. Recent years have witnessed constant evolutions, from new consensus protocols that <a href="https://tendermint.com/">rival proof-of-work</a>, to platforms that <a href="https://www.avalabs.org/">increase scalability</a> for smart contract applications, to protocols that utilize evidence certificates to <a href="https://z.cash/">enable privacy</a> while maintaining trustlessness.</p><p id="0d930353-7af1-4742-b6c4-63a73d19a135" class="">The vision of a trustless, decentralized world has certainly opened the doors for a wide array of possibilities, but the advantages of fully sovereign ownership of virtual assets have also come with new risks. These decentralized pieces of monetary property require the owners to be fully responsible for safeguarding the assets. Business and technical vulnerabilities, whether from accidentally misplacing it or from a malicious hack, may lead to the permanent, irretrievable loss of digital funds.</p><p id="f8570504-36df-4167-86b6-a343cad51bd1" class="">As a consequence of the rapid rise in value throughout this nascent industry, hackers have preyed on insecure code and untested economic models. Over <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2019/08/15/hackers-stole-over-4-billion-from-crypto-crimes-in-2019-so-far-up-from-1-7-billion-in-all-of-2018/">$4B was stolen in 2019</a>, with attacks seemingly evolving as quickly as the underlying security approaches. Even as projects take a more serious approach to defend against the known manipulations, hackers have countered by digging up new attack vectors and employing multi-stage manipulations.</p><figure id="fc55e1a1-4c97-44f0-8bdc-ab041b27bbf1" class="image"><a href="CertiKChain%20Whitepaper%20bbfe2ad7d408464eabb540d53cdadf38/Frame_2_one_color.png"><img style="width:432px" src="CertiKChain%20Whitepaper%20bbfe2ad7d408464eabb540d53cdadf38/Frame_2_one_color.png"/></a></figure><p id="90143938-c72e-4d0e-ad23-d4f39183f36c" class="">Different from traditional distributed computing systems, the blockchain infrastructure and application logic are highly transparent to hackers, often entirely open-sourced and immutable following deployment. This makes it extremely difficult to maintain the persistent security of digital assets, as the transparency of the code provides hackers with a playground of hints and holes. Keeping with the pace of this unprecedented growth of digital asset value, the frequency of digital attacks and unintended glitches has also grown exponentially. For blockchain to be adopted and sustained, it is paramount that the security and perhaps even more importantly, the correctness of blockchain artifacts (both infrastructure and application logic), are trustworthy.</p><p id="d4b0ee48-54e8-478a-ae2d-716207bad901" class="">Decentralization is one of the major motivations of blockchain systems, compared to traditional distributed computer systems. In order to fully realize the decentralization vision, the security of blockchains must also be decentralized. Unfortunately, today this is untrue. Existing blockchain security analysis is conducted in a centralized process through a handful of security auditors. Following an audit, many projects, along with their communities, signal their security and correctness by showcasing that they have undergone an audit. However, few users take the time, or have the ability, to investigate independently whether the code is truly secure and correct; instead, they trust in the centralized process.</p><p id="b02a909f-ffc7-4dc1-a0bd-4799fe2aafbd" class="">Today, blockchain security has limitations because security is treated as an off-chain property of blockchain. When smart contracts have been successfully audited or verified, their security analysis stays off the chain, usually in the form of a detailed audit report. As it stands, security analysis may only be used indirectly; all smart contracts, whether they are secure or not, run the same way on blockchain without any differentiation or protection. Users are expected to conduct their own deep research as to whether smart contracts have been audited, by whom, and in what capacity. In the meantime, extremely risky smart contracts are still live and may interact with other smart contracts of unknown reliability. As DeFi hacks have shown, the ever-changing pieces of the DeFi world can lead to great losses, as the complex web of interactions may create unintended errors to even audited smart contracts. CertiK firmly believes that security intelligence should be accessible in real-time and on-chain, rather than off-chain, such that they bring a new added dimension of value into the blockchain world by allowing smart contract and chain execution to dynamically establish, validate, and differentiate the security levels of their peers.</p><p id="c0ca5e06-5472-4fe9-9d87-be62415bb1ec" class="">The goal of CertiK Chain is to become <em>the</em> infrastructure of provable trust for all. In addition to the suite of state-of-the-art security technologies adopted by CertiK Chain to establish its own  security and correctness, the blockchain serves as a platform to be used by all who seek the same assurances. For economics and performance, the Chain uses a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus protocol. For accessibility, the Chain uses the modular and inter-chain friendly Cosmos framework and has a virtual machine fully compatible with EVM. For the decentralization of security, the Chain has a built-in decentralized security oracle to prevent security attacks in real-time. For chain-level mitigation and protection of digital assets against security issues, the Chain has a built-in decentralized asset pool for crypto loss.</p><h2 id="203bcabb-6ff2-46e7-823f-346e8a547a26" class="">1.1 Security Across the Entire Project Lifecycle</h2><p id="276170a0-250c-4d2b-b213-44a037f9ee34" class="">To protect against the various vulnerabilities which may arise throughout the lifecycles of a blockchain project, the CertiK Foundation has developed a series of defenses for every stage.</p><p id="0b9accd2-8dd3-4949-98f3-966a7c811023" class=""><strong>Pre-Development</strong></p><p id="a0b55076-a36c-4898-b07a-4b10a5b04f9a" class="">A project’s risks begin even before source code is developed.

While professional security audits play an unquestionably important role in identifying vulnerabilities, the security results are based on a certain snapshot of the code and reported within text documents—this intelligence is unable to be used at the time when it&#x27;s needed most: immediately before a transaction is submitted. Many blockchain projects have the resources to procure and pay for third-party audits, but within DeFi, there&#x27;s been a trend of pseudo-anonymous projects gaining community users, even though their creators mention that no professional audits have been performed. For these instances, users may use CertiK’s decentralized Security Oracles to directly request the itemized security analysis of a smart contract without relying on the contract creators.</p><p id="947c9439-d8a5-43e9-9fa3-2142f4bf1674" class="">Additional Readings:</p><ul id="33af49dc-78df-48cd-b209-7cdaaa8f57c4" class="bulleted-list"><li><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-smart-chain-and-certik-amp-up-defi-security">CertiK Partners with Binance Smart Chain for Security Oracle Integration</a></li></ul><ul id="4f1ff1b8-cd61-4705-be09-2ea94d7402f1" class="bulleted-list"><li><a href="https://medium.com/certik-foundation/certik-integration-guide-on-binance-smart-chain-ca3e6a9caa69">Integration Guide for BSC Smart Contracts</a></li></ul><p id="a10922b7-fbd1-485a-bd09-c3c781725107" class=""><strong>Protection from Unexpected Losses</strong></p><p id="ec3b2c4a-2b9e-4d10-ab05-5230acee1214" class="">While the suite of defenses that CertiK offers may substantially eliminate risks of malfunctioning code and malicious attacks, it is impossible to be completely secure. Hackers keep an active pulse of the ecosystem and continually devise creative ways of manipulating people and programs. To assist with individualized risk management, CertiK has created the CertiKShield system, which provides a decentralized, fully flexible pool of community funds that utilize CertiK Chain’s unique voting and economics to enable reimbursements for any funds that are lost, stolen, frozen, or otherwise inaccessible. CertiK works in tandem with an audited blockchain project and its community to provide a discretionary pool of funds for the members to allocate. CTK is at the center of this system, rewarding members with staking rewards as they stake their funds into various CertiKShield Pools. This alternative to insurance provides some peace-of-mind in case any unpredictable losses occur.</p><h2 id="e094ffc2-8eaf-4e0b-83ae-55cd77aa4f69" class="">1.2 CTK Coin and Economic Model</h2><p id="fa9074f8-a3c7-4a24-81fc-c97390ace79c" class="">PLEASE NOTE: CRYPTOGRAPHIC COINS REFERRED TO IN THIS WHITE PAPER REFER TO CRYPTOGRAPHIC COINS ON A LAUNCHED BLOCKCHAIN THAT ADOPTS THE CERTIK SOFTWARE.

CTK is a non-refundable functional utility fuel that is used as the unit of exchange between participants on the CertiK Platform, as well as the rewards for participants who contribute and maintain the ecosystem of the CertiK Platform (as described below). CTK is an integral and indispensable part of the CertiK Platform because, in the absence of CTK, there would be no common unit of exchange to transact between those requesting work and those completing the work on the CertiK Platform.</p><p id="3ee2123a-3164-4c4c-abdf-18d90492cf0f" class="">For CertiK Chain, CTK is used to pay for gas fees, which are required to incentivize the decentralized community of nodes to validate the transaction. As decentralized applications are built and used on CertiK Chain, there will be an increased demand for CTK to pay for the desired transactions. As a proof-of-stake protocol based on the Tendermint PoS architecture, CertiK Chain provides staking rewards to the CTK bonded to validator nodes. These staking rewards are used to incentivize a network of secure, high availability validator nodes that strengthen the security of the entire blockchain</p><p id="f3e4b435-3b71-4a47-9141-d77f7cf81d69" class="">CertiK Chain&#x27;s Decentralized Security Oracle is a core dApp that requires CTK to function.

In addition to normal staking, CTK holders may choose to engage in &quot;active staking,&quot; or staking their CTK as collateral into any of the CertiKShield Pools in exchange for higher staking rewards. Active staking provides for an option of higher risk, yet higher rewards; participants&#x27; staked CTK is used as collateral to pay out approved claims, but also receive a portion of the fees paid out by purchasers of this protection. By staking CTK into a CertiKShield Pool, the participants automatically become members of the CertiKShield ecosystem, receiving a proportional amount of the CTK fees on top of their normal CTK staking rewards. Additionally, all members of CertiKShield Pools have the ability to vote on how to allocate the funds of CTK. </p><p id="366ee313-1add-4f62-bd5a-c017c190c6af" class="">CertiKShield Pools with fewer stakers may have higher reward potential, as the CTK payments are shared among a smaller group of members. This incentivizes smaller pools to grow, allowing for community protection across projects of all sizes and risks. As the pool of funds in specific a  CertiKShield Pool grows, the associated CTK rewards also increase, as the blockchain project initiating the CertiKShield Pool must pay larger fees. This establishes a system of supply and demand that is used to provide the space with greater protections and value. CTK is the medium of exchange to fund pools, pay for fees, earn rewards, and buy protection, providing an integral utility function for the system.</p><h3 id="a0824918-f9ee-4d2c-9ad4-49ab2b82c510" class=""><strong>Statement of CTK</strong></h3><p id="efdc4b4d-dfb6-4af7-92bd-686d51e97956" class="">CTK does not in any way represent any shareholding, participation, right, title, or interest in the Foundation, its affiliates, or any other company, enterprise or undertaking, nor will CTK entitle CTK holders to any promise of fees, revenue, profits or investment returns, and are not intended to constitute securities in Singapore or any relevant jurisdiction.

Systems like decentralized finance (DeFi) rely on oracles to relay data such as token prices, but these oracles typically relay relatively easy data feeds. In the perspective of security, information on the reliability of smart contracts would be crucial to know before interfacing with the code, but this information lives in audit reports located off-chain. The CertiK Security Oracle aims to decompose complex audit reports into smaller security primitives, which are readily available to be called on-chain to verify the security of a smart contract in real-time. These Security Oracle scores are dynamic, querying the latest security primitives and tests to aggregate the scores and produce insights into the reliability of the underlying code.</p><p id="d2b09bcd-9b8a-4edd-a2e7-2e6f43ee7d4e" class="">

</p><p id="aa745e31-73f5-4492-9771-2b769ff5018c" class="">Additionally, CertiK Security Oracles can be used to submit requests about unaudited smart contracts. Those requests are relayed to a decentralized group of security operators, who compete to earn the CTK transaction fee. The CertiK Oracle Combinator combines the various results from each operator into a score available on-chain. The fees of the transaction are shared among each operator that contributed security primitives for the request.</p><p id="eaad42d5-1eb9-4a37-bdc4-0832d597a56a" class="">By invoking CertiK Security Oracles to retrieve security intelligence, users can make better decisions concerning their potential transactions and external invocations. This decentralized system of information allows communities, such as those involved in the booming DeFi ecosystem, with the power to conduct real-time security checks. In the spirit of full decentralization, this evolution decentralizes security intelligence from a handful of security auditors to the entire blockchain community to be accessible on-chain upon demand.</p><p id="114eb062-2b01-41ab-9bb3-599e5af2c753" class="">

These Security Oracles live natively on the requested blockchain, so for instance, if a user would like to request security intelligence on an Ethereum smart contract, he or she would interact directly with the CertiK Security Oracle built on Ethereum. </p><p id="db4d1dbc-fe4f-4c04-aa7b-50af371d986a" class="">A completed request generates a security score, retrieved via decentralized efforts of security operators on CertiK Chain. Without having to be fully technically savvy or spending too much time, DeFi users can quickly obtain a metric that stands as a proxy to security. Of course, these scores are not intended to replace the full diligence process, but they can provide quick heuristics to gauge the security of any smart contract.</p><p id="11bdabb4-e00e-412e-af22-a76c99136a56" class="">In DeFi, it has become increasingly popular for unaudited smart contracts to be released pseudo-anonymously, and while the community understands the risk, they proceed to accept high risk for high rewards. These contracts go unaudited because it has been normally seen as the responsibility of the contract creator(s) to seek audits, but in these cases, the creator(s) elect not to. The CertiK Security Oracles decentralize the responsibility of conducting security analysis and instead give the power to the people to request security intelligence themselves.</p><p id="4c096d51-c292-401e-9337-eb3924936e9f" class="">Below, the code snippet describes a scenario in which a smart contract checks the security score when it attempts to make external function calls. In this case, it reverts when a real-time score retrieved does not meet the required threshold. The adoption of this increased diligence can help prevent unsafe transactions and manipulations before transactions occur, preventing unexpected losses.</p><p id="da6931e6-43bf-4eab-b17b-0d628992fba5" class="">

Centralized Finance has the backing of governments and large institutions, allowing for assurances like the United States FDIC insurance, which guarantees deposits of up to $250,000 per depositor. DeFi is unlikely to develop such centralized assurances, so initiatives like CertiKShield intend to bring together a decentralized community to offer similar protections.</p><p id="5c3b4007-38ba-4270-9ae8-9907f72fa382" class="">For blockchain and cryptocurrencies, the digital world poses great risks to reliably storing the assets. Whether the issue is a forgotten password, stolen private key, or frozen contract, the evidence of loss is almost solely visible in the digital world. For this reason, traditional insurance companies, which tend to focus on tangible assets (auto, home, health, life) are unlikely to have the interest (or the expertise) to offer their services to losses in the purely digital world. CertiK, on the other hand, is a deeply technical cybersecurity firm, securing over $8B in digital assets and working with some of the largest blockchain projects and enterprises.

In contrast to existing blockchain VMs, such as EVM and eWASM, a distinctive feature in the CertiK VM (CVM) is the ability to establish, query, and act on security knowledge at chain logic execution time for differentiating behaviors and enhancing protection.</p><p id="0fb8751d-8998-4595-a92a-0ffcffe663e5" class="">To capture and store security information on-chain—whether from auditing, formal verification, testing, or other means—CertiK Chain has the built-in support of proof certificates of all kinds.

In practice, the dynamic security knowledge deduced from information such as peers, data, and timing is often the most effective protection for chain logics execution. For this reason, CertiK Chain has a built-in Security Oracle, powered continuously by security experts and accessible by smart contracts for real-time security protection.</p><p id="33850bfc-b428-43d9-b4f9-6050eef23521" class="">As a decentralized system, blockchain should also decentralize its security, instead of relying on any particular authority or vendor.

Even if a smart contract is written 100% securely and correctly, during the transformation from human-readable code (letters) to machine-readable bytecode (1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s), there may be errors introduced that render the previous security checks obsolete. </p><p id="94796d20-ab10-472b-b0ca-c5ea08cc8d39" class="">As an intricately designed, security-first blockchain, the first goal of the CertiK Virtual Machine (CVM) is to achieve the advanced security of the VM code. The CVM will start with supporting bytecode and proofs generated by the DeepSEA certified compiler while running on top of CertiKOS, the world&#x27;s only fully certified, concurrent OS kernel/hypervisor. This hyper-secure trusted computing base (TCB) will limit attack vectors from insecure code. Eventually, the CVM will enforce sandboxing and isolation of any code that is not fully certified via mathematical proofs whilst being  completely formally verified itself.</p><p id="1eb4fb72-b573-481a-a7d9-80bf448a90c1" class="">The second goal of CVM (as well as CertiK Chain) is to enable security intelligence to become an on-chain, expressible value.<strong> </strong>This is unachievable in any of today&#x27;s blockchain virtual machines; security analysis is conducted and stored off-chain, so programs are unable to reference the results when considering performing a transaction. This limits the real value of security analysis, as the onus is on an individual to perform the diligence to find and investigate any previously conducted audit reports, prior to using a smart contract. However, by extending this security intelligence on-chain, more dynamic and actionable operations are enabled. For example, a secure smart contract may choose to differentiate its actions when interaction with secure and non-secure smart contracts; in real life, this differentiation is analogous to lenders who charge different rates based on a person&#x27;s credit score (or in this case, security score). </p><p id="19cc1d32-c24a-46e8-b2d8-ac2f209f56b8" class="">The CVM exposes smart contract and blockchain security information to VM code, enabling unprecedented ways to access, check, depend on, and even dynamically establish blockchain and smart contract security. On-chain security intelligence provides access to information for better decision-making. While unaudited/unverified smart contracts may still execute in the CVM, there is higher transparency to those seeking to interact with it.</p><p id="d411e856-1f4b-485c-a0e4-0beb1549c5e8" class="">A long-term goal for CVM is the separation of chain state access and general computation. VMs stand in between the smart contract/plugin/dApp logic and the persistent chain state access/replication logic. Many of today&#x27;s VMs, including Ethereum&#x27;s EVM, handle both blockchain state access and general computation in the same way, with no separation between VM instructions and smart contract language features. This structure loses out on the many good ways to write, debug, and run general computations that have already existed before blockchain. While some chains / VMs try to use libraries instead for chain state access, but that doesn&#x27;t fix the problem because it comes with its problems, such as language-dependency, API inconsistency, and still no isolation between general computation and state access. To remedy these issues, the CVM will use the leading universal VM, the x86-64 OS process model, while potentially expanding to other ISAs such as arm64 in the future. Blockchain state access will be provided as OS abstractions (memory page, files, signals, procfs, syscalls, etc.) to CVM code. Existing bytecode VMs will still be fully supported and actually become middleware between their VM code and the CVM, meaning that the CVM will be language agnostic. As a result, all existing tooling—whether designed for the blockchain world or not—will be reusable for CVM code development. This OS process model also provides an excellent abstraction level for CVM code protection and isolations.</p><p id="db84c6f4-a02c-4766-8c1b-0560e3e5f7f8" class="">

A proof object is any kind of machine-readable representation of a proof which can be independently checked to establish that a theorem is true. Currently the most commonly used form are the .vo files produced be the Coq proof assistant: they contain only the logical inferences used to prove a theorem, but omit the tactics and proof search which was used to construct it, so they can be checked by a utility program which is simpler and more trustworthy than the full Coq system.</p><p id="9fdf0138-1b84-4380-b89a-7d04105a96aa" class="">Proof objects are naturally trust-less, but with the current state of the art the only way to check a proof is to run the checker yourself. With the CertiK Chain, we will provide a decentralised way to confirm that a proof object is valid. The user will compile the proof using Coq, preprocess .vo files with a CertiK-developed tool, and submit it to a set of proof-validating nodes. If enough nodes agree that the proof is valid, it will be added to the chain state. In addition to Coq, the validators will also handle other theorem provers such as Z3. </p><p id="32216cec-39da-454c-a623-483ed9804dbb" class="">The provers will be responsible for splitting a development into a &quot;theorem statement&quot; and a proof of it, using the Coq module system. The chain state then includes a hash of the theorem statement (the chain nodes do not need to store the full proof, although it will be made available off-chain, e.g. on IPFS). Similar to certificates, the CVM lets user contracts query this database, so it is possible to make decentralized decisions using proofs, for example, upgrading a contract only if the upgraded version comes with a correctness proof, or posting a bounty for a theorem to be proven. </p><p id="a36cef1b-2dbc-4d8c-9fe4-32241ee52581" class="">

DeepSEA is a secure programming language and compiler toolchain developed by researchers from CertiK, Yale University, and Columbia University to allow secure smart contract development, providing a way to formally verify difficult correctness properties about smart contracts using the Coq proof assistant. DeepSEA has the potential to eliminate some of the most critical, yet avoidable source code flaws, and its development has been supported by research grants from the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-foundation-funds-columbia-yale-researchers-work-on-smart-contract-language">Ethereum Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.datascience.columbia.edu/columbia-ibm-center-supports-breakthrough-research-blockchain-technology">Columbia-IBM</a>, and the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/qtum-awards-400k-grant-to-columbia-university-research-team-for-smart-contracts-rd">Qtum Foundation</a>.</p><p id="90b2eaa0-1b08-4f92-8b47-011a56d22c94" class="">Much existing work on smart contract verification is built around automatic theorem provers such as Z3. These provers provide convenience by simply requiring a developer to state a theorem and then program attempts to prove that it holds true. However, they are most useful for relatively simple proofs about e.g. arithmetic expressions and data structures like arrays. In cases where the theorem requires creativity or requires custom definitions to even state (such as many of the complex requirements in smart contracts), automatic tools tend to get stuck. Coq is an example of an interactive proof assistant, which means that it doesn’t prove the theorems for users: instead, the user must write both the theorem statement and the proof, and Coq checks whether the proof is correct or not. While this involves more work, it permits arbitrarily advanced mathematics.</p><p id="495b110f-67c3-4389-93b3-9063c16c8059" class="">To reason about a contract in Coq, we first need to define a model of what it is doing, then load it into the Coq proof assistant. To achieve this securely, contracts are written in the fairly small programming language of DeepSEA. The DeepSEA compiler both compiles the contract into CVM bytecode and also outputs the representation that can be loaded into Coq. This allows the reasoning of a convenient, high-level representation of the contract, and because the DeepSEA compiler has been fully verified to be correct, the generated Coq contract representation is ensured to match the compiled CVM bytecode execution.</p><p id="406bf427-9598-4c83-91da-d6d02337106c" class="">

On the one hand, in order to be easy to formally reason about, programs should be as high-level as possible, ideally pure functional programs operating on high-level data types like unbounded numbers and lists. On the other hand, executing blockchain contracts is expensive, so we cannot afford luxuries like big integers or a garbage collector. The DeepSEA approach to this problem was informed by the experience of verifying the CertiKOS kernel. We provide a small language that avoids features that are hard to reason about, but at the same time can be executed without an elaborate runtime system.</p><p id="ec3fc455-05b0-4a0a-a45b-6d2d182fc8fc" class="">A DeepSEA program consists of a set of <em>objects</em>, and each of the objects has a set of <em>fields</em> and <em>methods</em>. In the CVM case, these correspond to contracts, storage, and methods. In this way we ensure that all contract data is encapsulated behind the object interfaces, so each method can update fields but otherwise behaves like a function. Similar to e.g. Facebook’s Move language there is no way to pass around pointers to the “inside” of an object, so proofs don’t have to worry about aliasing and frame rules, although the implementation may use pointers to big data as an optimization hidden from the programmer. Therefore, the meaning of a DeepSEAprogram can be modeled as a set of pure functions that can be reasoned about equationally (like in high-school algebra) inside a proof assistant.</p><p id="aeae6c27-0295-4536-aba9-8955ee71d384" class="">A set of objects can be gathered into a <em>layer</em>, which represents a coherent view of the entire contract state. Finally, the language supports <em>abstract refinement</em> of layers, where the programmer manually writes a specification for some methods and provides a proof that it’s satisfied. For example, one can implement a tree data structure in terms of arrays and indices, and then abstractly refine it into a simple tree data type like you might write it in a functional programming language.</p><p id="ba48bc96-0e73-45c4-a307-5e750e2b4873" class="">As a representative example, the following is an excerpt from a contract implementing a second-price blind auction.

The frontend (type-checker) is implemented in OCaml, while the middle-end is written in Coq. The compiler first parses and type-checks the input file, and elaborates it into a simpler language, the DeepSEA typed core language. The type-annotated abstract syntax tree of the core term is printed out into a Coq source file, and then the middle-end produces both the C implementation and the functional specification from that representation. The front-end also translates layer calculus expressions from the DeepSEA source file into calls to the various lemmas of the Certified Abstraction Layers library—composing specifications and proofs for individual methods into a specification and proof for the entire system.</p><p id="ab6dee09-4c55-4290-b536-4820dd736162" class="">To be precise, the language that the middle-end targets are a subset of C, which we refer to as “MiniC”. The bulk of the middle-end implementation consists of a theorem, proven in Coq, that the command translation is correct with respect to the desugaring. The correctness theorem is proven once and for all. Then each time the user compiles a DeepSEA program, the front-end generates a set of Coq files which apply the desugaring and program extraction functions, and the compilation correctness theorem, to the intermediate representation of that input program. The end result is a proof that the generated functional specification matches the extracted C code. The user can load those files into Coq, and compose that proof with manually written proofs about the functional specifications.</p><p id="953e2d2d-5f41-42b5-9d00-6d9872290f19" class=""><strong>Blockchain Backends</strong>. In order to use DeepSEA for smart contracts, we develop backends which translate the MiniC program that the middle-end produces into blockchain bytecode. In other words, it forms a replacement for a C compiler when targeting a blockchain target like CVM or WebAssembly instead of x86 assembly. The verified part of the backend produces CVM assembly code, then an untrusted assembler/pretty-printer converts identifiers to integer offsets (for jump labels, storage identifiers, and method entry points), and outputs bytes.</p><p id="2da77c4c-8938-474e-8853-1bdb1376e45c" class="">The backend proof takes the form of a number of lemmas, each saying that the translated program is equivalent to the source program. For example, the backend first transfers MiniC programs into a language, called Clike, which expands “complex” values (e.g., a hashtable) into storage and pointers. As for the function clike_rvalue translating MiniC expressions to Clike expressions, we prove a lemma</p><pre id="de43f5d8-e7a2-4717-96af-c13425335d11" class="code"><code>Lemma rvalue_equiv: forall (eMiniC eClike: expr) (result: val) (id: ident_ext),

Each compilation phase defines such a relation, e.g.</p><pre id="1b308df2-d299-4521-b4d4-15d5743491b7" class="code"><code>Inductive match_states: state -&gt; state -&gt; Prop :=

In one pilot project, we have built a small &quot;declarative&quot; contract language that compiled via the DeepSEA backend, and which can be used as a reference example for other users of the compiler.

At an architectural level, this is achieved by having mining nodes owned by different people in different locations using different set-ups.

Because Linux consists of 27 million lines of C code, it is virtually impossible to ensure that it is free of critical security bugs. According to the CVE vulnerability database, 347 security problems in the Linux kernel were discovered during 2018-2019, and 14 of which were of “critical” severity. Furthermore, the runtime environment of such a computer also includes a large runtime system (e.g. the standard C library) which itself may contain vulnerabilities. Additionally, if the system also runs on a cloud computer, there&#x27;s another dependency on the reliability of the underlying hypervisor. </p><p id="7659316b-d629-40f9-acb7-f603120d20b2" class="">A similar problem affects oracle systems, as oracles are computers that feed raw data (such as currency exchange rates) to smart contracts.

It is responsible for controlling access to hardware devices and data files, and to prevent programs from interfering with memory used by other programs, so a bug in the kernel can let a hacker take complete control of the entire computer and bypass all security guarantees of the programs running on it. Furthermore, all programs running on a computer will use services provided by the operating system, so in order to formally verify the application programs one needs a formal specification of what the operating system is doing. If the operating system itself is not verified, then that specification might not correspond to what the OS is actually doing, so even if the kernel itself is not buggy subsequent verification efforts may be invalid because the application programmer misunderstood what specification the OS was supposed to follow.</p><p id="d099d1a1-43a3-4c90-9d22-bb5b29fcd59c" class="">In CertiKOS that cannot happen, because the operating system comes with a formal specification written in Coq which says <em>exactly</em> what each call to OS should do, and a formal proof that the C code follows the specification. This proof already implies that the code does not have any of the errors that typically leads to security vulnerabilities; for example it has no buffer overflows, no memory leaks or non-termination, no NULL pointer access or ill-typed pointer access, no arithmetic exceptions, etc. Furthermore, we have used the high-level specification to prove that the kernel satisfies a “non-interference” security property: if you configure CertiKOS to put two programs into separate compartments, there is no way for any information to leak from one compartment to the other. And finally, the high-level specification can be used to prove that application programs running on top of CertiKOS are correct. So the verified kernel lays the foundation for a complete verified software stack.</p><p id="ab74fa85-a3bd-46c8-b39d-1491591d7a19" class="">The current version of CertiKOS is much smaller and provides fewer features than mainstream kernels such as Linux. It consists of about 11,000 lines of code, and it implements memory management, multithreading, and a few device drivers. On the other hand, it currently lacks e.g. a file system or a network stack. The feature set implemented by CertiKOS is similar to what a hypervisor or a microkernel provides, and it can be used to run a hypervisor, which can then run e.g. a Linux system inside a secure compartment. In the DARPA-sponsored HACMS program, CertiKOS was used as a hypervisor to host the software of a robotic land vehicle, ensuring e.g. that even if a hacker broke into the radar software compartment, they still would not be able to influence the guidance software. And CertiK is currently using CertiKOS as a hypervisor hosting nodes for the CertiK chain.</p><figure id="fb05dff3-2f6b-4a62-9c8d-cffc425ad0e2" class="image"><a href="CertiKChain%20Whitepaper%20bbfe2ad7d408464eabb540d53cdadf38/sysarch.png"><img style="width:1136px" src="CertiKChain%20Whitepaper%20bbfe2ad7d408464eabb540d53cdadf38/sysarch.png"/></a></figure><p id="3c754766-a11a-48fa-bfa4-b5d49bd8ffe8" class="">(Components of the CertiKOS kernel)</p><p id="e1f53934-e465-491e-98eb-efa972f69b3d" class="">The research emphasis in the CertiKOS project has been on finding a way to formally verify such a large program without excessive labor, resulting in a novel approach which we call <em>Concurrent Certified Abstraction Layers </em>(CCAL).

The layered approach also sets CertiKOS apart from microkernel projects: although the current feature set is limited, the intention is to keep extending it by adding more layers.

CertiKOS will begin with supporting much smaller, yet individually critical operations, such as the deployment of a node, relaying of an oracle feed, or swapping of two digital assets.</p><p id="6631602d-e72e-4a76-8492-78dedc559ae9" class="">Supporting Linux requires adding several types of functionality to the kernel. First, entirely new modules must be integrated, such as a filesystem and a network stack, and hardware driver for the new computer hardware. Second, in order to run software written for Linux with minimal modifications, a compatibility layer must be added to export the API that those programs expect. For example, CertiKOS already has system calls for creating threads or waiting on condition variables, but a new set of system calls needs to be added with names and parameters corresponding to the Linux interface.</p><p id="eb2a1f0c-585d-45b1-9887-bb9f29a882c4" class="">In a major milestone, CertiKOS ran a Coq-certifying primitive, which accepts Coq source files, runs the Coq proof checker, and replies with a cryptographically signed certificate that the purported proofs are indeed valid. The development of CertiKOS will continue, supporting more software, running on more hardware, and utilizing other innovations such as trusted enclaves.

Once the proposal has been accepted by governance, contributors can submit a software upgrade proposal and claim the bounty.</p><p id="24111603-1fc7-4845-acfe-f51cff97d4fc" class="">Community Pool Spend Proposals transfer tokens from the community pool to an address if they pass. The recipient of the tokens could be a chain user who has done—or plans to do—development work or security work for the chain. The recipient could also be a smart contract that distributes the tokens to multiple addresses after conditions have been met. For example, a bug bounty smart contract could be funded by a community pool spend proposal. When a user finds a bug, the owner of the smart contract could send some tokens to that user as a reward.

The number of tokens staked determines the influence on the decision, i.e., voting power. Stake Delegators adopt the vote of the Validators they have chosen to delegate to, unless they decide to cast their own vote, which would overwrite the Validators’ voting choice.

In most cases, unanimous approval is needed for a proposal to pass the security council. In the very limited cases where the vote needs to be done by majority, each Certifier has the same voting power — in the case of a 50/50 split, the Certifier elected earliest is the tie-breaker.

He or she will earn interest based on the amount of delegated tokens. Since only the bonded validators will get the staking rewards and collected fees distribution, only those delegated to one of the bonded validators will be able to earn corresponding rewards. The minimum staking amount per transaction is 1 CTK. Interest rates and the token minting/burning process are discussed in the next section.</p><p id="918b843c-f629-406b-a981-af0d86bc0117" class="">Validators, since they are part of the Tendermint consensus algorithm, can be punished if they make infractions either deliberately or unknowingly. There are only two cases where the staked CTK is slashed: double signing and being offline. A bonded validator is &quot;being offline&quot; if it does not participate in the consensus protocol for more than a certain time. Since the chain is still in development, there may be non-malicious infractions. Thus, a validator is only slashed once for multiple infractions. The validator enters the tombstone state after the slashing, where it cannot get slashed until it un-jails himself.</p><p id="42b89543-850f-4ebd-a115-6b815749fd99" class="">Validators may unbond their staked tokens. The validator will go through a 14-day period in which the tokens are locked. In the case of a validator unbonding, the delegators of the validator may choose to re-delegate to other validators to continue earning staking rewards. Otherwise, the delegators will not be able to earn further rewards, as the original unbonded validator is effectively excluded from the validator set.</p><p id="de217f92-902b-426f-80e6-ff1cafea4352" class="">Listed below are important parameters for rewards and punishments.

As a result, the Community Pool will get another amount of newly minted CTK each block to stay at the same fraction compared to the total supply of CTK (as mentioned, this is set to 20% by default). The newly minted tokens will be immediately usable (unlocked) and delegators may choose to re-stake them to validators.
