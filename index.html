The CertiK Foundation has supported the development of a robust suite of technologies and tools to ensure that security and correctness are maintained throughout every phase of the blockchain lifecycle, from initial development to live usage.</p><p id="8f454687-804e-4c47-8acf-8fb35682b179" class="">The CertiK ecosystem is envisaged to provide end-to-end security solutions for blockchains, decentralized applications, and other mission-critical software applications. While the components of the CertiK ecosystem integrate natively with CertiK Chain, the CertiK Foundation believes in cross-collaborative bridges with other blockchains, as security should not be a choice, but a necessity. With breakthrough technologies and techniques for proving security and correctness, the CertiK Foundation aims to provide the infrastructure of provable trust for all.</p><figure id="519909e5-82d1-4ee8-b7c4-c48ff8fd5294" class="image"><a href="CertiKChain%20Whitepaper%20staging%20519909e582d14ee8b7c4c48ff8fd5294/Comp_1_1.gif"><img style="width:672px" src="CertiKChain%20Whitepaper%20staging%20519909e582d14ee8b7c4c48ff8fd5294/Comp_1_1.gif"/></a></figure><h1 id="d733427b-4368-4003-8771-c54c3771b866" class=""><strong>1 Introduction</strong></h1><p id="8785d89a-3b7a-40e2-860c-6f596642551e" class="">Since the advent of Satoshi Nakamoto’s peer-to-peer electronic cash system, called<a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"> Bitcoin</a>, the digital world has seen a slew of innovations pushing forward a<a href="https://ethereum.org/"> trustless</a>, decentralized alternative to today’s centralized world. Recent years have witnessed constant evolutions, from new consensus protocols that<a href="https://tendermint.com/"> rival proof-of-work</a>, to platforms that<a href="https://www.avalabs.org/"> increase scalability</a> for smart contract applications, to protocols that utilize evidence certificates to<a href="https://z.cash/"> enable privacy</a> while maintaining trustlessness.</p><p id="b0a03122-23ad-48d1-af84-f0496b5f8a3b" class="">The vision of a trustless, decentralized world has certainly opened the doors for a wide array of possibilities, but the advantages of fully sovereign ownership of virtual assets have also come with new risks. These decentralized pieces of monetary property require the owners to be fully responsible for safeguarding the assets. Business and technical vulnerabilities, whether from accidentally misplacing it or from a malicious hack, may lead to the permanent, irretrievable loss of digital funds.</p><p id="aad81070-74b8-4e96-8a77-91ae118d4c5a" class="">As a consequence of the rapid rise in value throughout this nascent industry, hackers have preyed on insecure code and untested economic models. Over<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2019/08/15/hackers-stole-over-4-billion-from-crypto-crimes-in-2019-so-far-up-from-1-7-billion-in-all-of-2018/"> $4B was stolen in 2019</a>, with attacks seemingly evolving as quickly as the underlying security approaches. Even as projects take a more serious approach to defend against the known manipulations, hackers have countered by digging up new attack vectors and employing multi-stage manipulations.</p><p id="615303d8-d704-48a6-b6db-155982284be2" class="">

This makes it extremely difficult to maintain the persistent security of digital assets, as the transparency of the code provides hackers with a playground of hints and holes. Keeping with the pace of this unprecedented growth of digital asset value, the frequency of digital attacks and unintended glitches has also grown exponentially. For blockchain to be adopted and sustained, it is paramount that the security and perhaps even more importantly, the correctness of blockchain artifacts (both infrastructure and application logic), are trustworthy.</p><p id="c1cc5f72-3db4-4ab0-887b-114100355aca" class="">Decentralization is one of the major motivations of blockchain systems, compared to traditional distributed computer systems. In order to fully realize the decentralization vision, the security of blockchains must also be decentralized. Unfortunately, today this is untrue. Existing blockchain security analysis is conducted in a centralized process through a handful of security auditors. Following an audit, many projects, along with their communities, signal their security and correctness by showcasing that they have undergone an audit. However, few users take the time, or have the ability, to investigate independently whether the code is truly secure and correct; instead, they trust in the centralized process.</p><p id="00f080bc-6e06-4315-abfc-24e893dd1538" class="">Today, blockchain security has limitations because security is treated as an off-chain property of blockchain. When smart contracts have been successfully audited or verified, their security analysis stays off the chain, usually in the form of a detailed audit report. As it stands, security analysis may only be used indirectly; all smart contracts, whether they are secure or not, run the same way on blockchain without any differentiation or protection. Users are expected to conduct their own deep research as to whether smart contracts have been audited, by whom, and in what capacity. In the meantime, extremely risky smart contracts are still live and may interact with other smart contracts of unknown reliability. As DeFi hacks have shown, the ever-changing pieces of the DeFi world can lead to great losses, as the complex web of interactions may create unintended errors to even audited smart contracts. CertiK firmly believes that security intelligence should be accessible in real-time and on-chain, rather than off-chain, such that they bring a new added dimension of value into the blockchain world by allowing smart contract and chain execution to dynamically establish, validate, and differentiate the security levels of their peers.</p><p id="2f2b9c1c-4dbf-4ff3-b1bb-240321623c26" class="">The goal of CertiK Chain is to become <em>the</em> infrastructure of provable trust for all. In addition to the suite of state-of-the-art security technologies adopted by CertiK Chain to establish its own security and correctness, the blockchain serves as a platform to be used by all who seek the same assurances. For economics and performance, the Chain uses a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus protocol. For accessibility, the Chain uses the modular and inter-chain friendly Cosmos framework and has a virtual machine fully compatible with EVM. For the decentralization of security, the Chain has a built-in decentralized security oracle to prevent security attacks in real-time. For chain-level mitigation and protection of digital assets against security issues, the Chain has a built-in decentralized asset pool for crypto loss.</p><h2 id="1f69740f-f984-450a-b40f-b6863cb08cdb" class=""><strong>1. 1 Security Across the Entire Project Lifecycle</strong></h2><p id="1f6190af-c8ba-4461-adca-e5fbaf147021" class="">To protect against the various vulnerabilities which may arise throughout the lifecycles of a blockchain project, the CertiK Foundation has developed a series of defenses for every stage.</p><p id="99e62534-5bc3-4344-a799-68dfe8e7ca80" class="">

Hackers keep an active pulse of the ecosystem and continually devise creative ways of manipulating people and programs. To assist with individualized risk management, CertiK is also proposing the creation of a CertiKShield system, which is expected to provide a decentralized, fully flexible pool of community funds that utilize CertiK Chain’s unique voting and economics to enable reimbursements for any funds that are lost, stolen, frozen, or otherwise inaccessible. CTK is at the center of this system, rewarding members with staking rewards as they stake their funds into various CertiKShield Pools. This alternative to insurance can provide some peace-of-mind and risk mitigation in case any unpredictable losses occur.</p><h2 id="0b817f1c-2b05-4d0a-b8cb-f3a3868f719e" class=""><strong>1. 2 CTK Coin and Economic Model</strong></h2><p id="e86e7449-1e0b-41a6-94a2-cf8e2353450b" class="">The native digital fuel of the CertiK Platform (&quot;CTK&quot;) is a major component of the ecosystem on the CertiK Platform. CTK is designed to be a functional utility fuel that is used as the unit of exchange between participants on the CertiK Platform, as well as the rewards for participants who contribute and maintain the ecosystem of the CertiK Platform (as described below). CTK is an integral and indispensable part of the CertiK Platform because, in the absence of CTK, there would be no common unit of exchange to transact between those requesting work and those completing the work on the CertiK Platform.</p><p id="927d9109-a1ca-4a2b-91af-5983b7abddcf" class="">For CertiK Chain, CTK is used to pay for gas fees, which are required to incentivize the decentralized community of nodes to validate the transaction. As a proof-of-stake protocol based on the Tendermint PoS architecture, CertiK Chain provides staking rewards to the CTK bonded to validator nodes. These staking rewards are used to incentivize a network of secure, high availability validator nodes that strengthen the security of the entire blockchain</p><p id="f8aa4a59-3733-4bda-bbf6-37abffb2d1d3" class="">CertiK Chain&#x27;s Decentralized Security Oracle is a core dApp that requires CTK to function.

In addition to normal staking, CTK holders may choose to engage in &quot;active staking,&quot; or staking their CTK as collateral into any of the CertiKShield Pools in exchange for higher staking rewards. Active staking provides for an option of higher risk, yet higher rewards; participants&#x27; staked CTK is used as collateral to pay out approved claims, but also receive a portion of the fees paid out by purchasers of this protection. By staking CTK into a CertiKShield Pool, the participants automatically become members of the CertiKShield ecosystem, receiving CTK fee rewards on top of their normal CTK staking rewards. Additionally, all members of CertiKShield Pools have the ability to vote on certain governance decisions relating to the CertiK Foundation.</p><p id="eac9aac5-ec88-445b-aed0-6e0df5b53ce7" class="">CertiKShield Pools with fewer stakers may have higher reward potential, as the CTK payments are shared among a smaller group of members. This incentivizes smaller pools to grow, allowing for community protection across projects of all sizes and risks. This establishes a system of supply and demand that is expected to provide the space with greater protections and value. CTK is the medium of exchange to fund pools, pay for fees, earn rewards, and purchase protection, providing an integral utility function for the system.</p><h1 id="76c01ef0-d256-4e42-bb22-4462dc544230" class=""><strong>2 CertiK Security Oracle</strong></h1><h2 id="9957eb0c-6e43-4dc4-8c82-d25bda3805ea" class=""><strong>Overview</strong></h2><p id="fb387ee3-1788-4e56-b81b-f2412e2952f3" class="">Blockchain oracles play an important role in connecting off-chain data to be usable on-chain by smart contracts. Systems like decentralized finance (DeFi) rely on oracles to relay data such as token prices, but these oracles typically relay relatively easy data feeds. From the perspective of security, information on the reliability of smart contracts would be crucial to know before interfacing with the code, but this information lives in audit reports located off-chain. The CertiK Security Oracle aims to decompose complex audit reports into smaller security primitives, which are readily available to be called on-chain to verify the security of a smart contract in real-time. These Security Oracle scores are dynamic, querying the latest security primitives and tests to aggregate the scores and produce insights into the reliability of the underlying code.</p><figure id="ef80cb1b-1c3d-458e-93a0-2e58950daf94" class="image"><a href="CertiKChain%20Whitepaper%20staging%20519909e582d14ee8b7c4c48ff8fd5294/oracle_flow.png"><img style="width:576px" src="CertiKChain%20Whitepaper%20staging%20519909e582d14ee8b7c4c48ff8fd5294/oracle_flow.png"/></a></figure><p id="360c4b3d-6c01-4fc4-aa1a-0bc241bcc73d" class="">Additionally, CertiK Security Oracles can be used to submit requests about unaudited smart contracts.

This decentralized system of information allows communities, such as those involved in the booming DeFi ecosystem, with the power to conduct real-time security checks.

Without having to be fully technically savvy or spending too much time, DeFi users can quickly obtain a metric that stands as a proxy to security. Of course, these scores are not intended to replace the full diligence process, but they can provide quick heuristics to gauge the security of any smart contract.</p><p id="8fae1b5d-d754-4d61-9ef1-80544bf9a53e" class="">In DeFi, it has become increasingly popular for unaudited smart contracts to be released pseudo-anonymously, and while the community understands the risk, they proceed to accept high risk for high rewards. These contracts go unaudited because it has been normally seen as the responsibility of the contract creator(s) to seek audits, but in these cases, the creator(s) elect not to.

While the malicious activity of hackers poses as one obvious cause of asset loss, a large percentage of the losses were also attributed to code malfunctions or human error. Code malfunctions may include assets that were inadvertently frozen within inaccessible contracts or irretrievable within ungovernable DAOs. Human error may include something as simple as forgetting one’s password or something as unfortunate as a Ledger damaged in a house fire or the death of the only person who may know the location of a private key.</p><p id="f006677d-5f1c-4d14-9605-843cccc91bfc" class="">With the self-sovereign functionality of cryptocurrencies, it is the full responsibility of the asset owner to bear the risk of these circumstances that lead to losses; sometimes things can be preventable, but other times, they are not. To lessen the burden for any specific individual to undertake the absolute responsibility of preventing these losses, CertiK developed the CertiKShield Pool system, which utilizes the unique staking, governance, and security features of CertiK Chain.</p><p id="2d135d2e-c737-4bba-a47d-8e3bab11eff8" class="">A CertiKShield Pool is a flexible, decentralized pool of CTK that uses CertiK Chain on-chain governance system to reimburse lost, stolen, or inaccessible assets from any blockchain network. CertiKShield Pools are intended to serve as discretionary community funds used to protect its members, who may be holding $ETH, $BNB, $USDT, or any other cryptoasset. In an event of irretrievable asset loss, such as tokens stolen or lost through a smart contract hack or frozen contract, the members of specific CertiKShield Pools may submit detailed Claim Proposals to the other members of the pool, thereby opening a voting period for the community to determine whether reimbursement is appropriate. This decentralized, on-chain voting process allows every member of a CertiKShield Pool to actively participate in determining reasonable coverage scenarios, creating a dynamic and fully flexible coverage model. The cost of reserving funds from the CertiKShield Pool for personal reimbursement of loss assets will be directly tied to the CertiK Security Oracle score, with lower scores (which represent more risk) requiring higher fees for protection.</p><p id="40305306-2263-438d-ac1e-37df9532b977" class="">

Because blockchain networks are often dealing with young and novel technologies, their early supporters often end up bearing the brunt of the risk. Instead, those early supporters should be treated as the most valuable contributors to blockchain projects, not their guinea pigs. CertiKShield allows members to establish a discretionary pool of funds that can be used as reimbursements if there are any unexpected issues that happen to their supporters.</p><p id="204fa68e-6c98-4b56-b2b4-1b97b5e2a0c8" class="">In order to request a reimbursement, any eligible member, whether from the blockchain project or from an individual, must submit a Claim Proposal with a Submission Fee.

This keeps incentives aligned, as blockchain projects directly reward the Members who are providing collateral to support their ecosystem&#x27;s protection, and Members are incentivized to contribute to the Pool in order to earn part of these fees.</p><p id="13ce2069-014a-4713-b33b-dec41099b540" class="">

In practice, the dynamic security knowledge deduced from information such as peers, data, and timing is often the most effective protection for chain logics execution. For this reason, CertiK Chain has a built-in Security Oracle, powered continuously by security experts and accessible by smart contracts for real-time security protection.</p><p id="cb3e2fec-c818-426b-a756-707f8f5a8bf7" class="">As a decentralized system, blockchain should also decentralize its security, instead of relying on any particular authority or vendor. In CertiK Chain, all security-related decisions and confirmations are done in a decentralized fashion via on-chain security governance that reflects the consensus of all chain security stakeholders. In particular, CertiKShield will have a decentralized pool for protecting blockchain users from security-related losses.</p><p id="affc3ece-5778-44b1-9a85-a501a290f94f" class="">Ultimately, however, decentralized blockchain security of any kind cannot be fully trusted, except by using rigorous mathematical methods—even proof-of-work (PoW) cannot be trusted if the code that does the cryptographic computation is implemented wrongly. The only known way to achieve truly trustless security to date is by utilizing (independently) machine-checkable mathematical proofs of the blockchain artifacts, which include both chain infrastructure and chain logics. By applying state-of-the-art research, CertiK Chain utilizes these proofs wherever practical to create the most robust, security-first blockchain in the world.</p><p id="c8e65b69-ac45-4277-aa29-5e656fc62a42" class="">

Even if a smart contract is written 100% securely and correctly, during the transformation from human-readable code (letters) to machine-readable bytecode (1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s), there may be errors introduced that render the previous security checks obsolete.</p><p id="0b5c7dcb-a177-49b0-9bb0-e4735f896bb8" class="">As an intricately designed, security-first blockchain, the first goal of the CertiK Virtual Machine (CVM) is to achieve the advanced security of the VM code. The CVM will start with supporting bytecode and proofs generated by the DeepSEA certified compiler while running on top of CertiKOS, the world&#x27;s only fully certified, concurrent OS kernel/hypervisor. This hyper-secure trusted computing base (TCB) will limit attack vectors from insecure code. Eventually, the CVM will enforce sandboxing and isolation of any code that is not fully certified via mathematical proofs whilst being completely formally verified itself.</p><p id="2aed8ed7-d754-447a-a243-16add7c38449" class="">The second goal of CVM (as well as CertiK Chain) is to enable security intelligence to become an on-chain, expressible value. This is unachievable in any of today&#x27;s blockchain virtual machines; security analysis is conducted and stored off-chain, so programs are unable to reference the results when considering performing a transaction. This limits the real value of security analysis, as the onus is on an individual to perform the diligence to find and investigate any previously conducted audit reports, prior to using a smart contract. However, by extending this security intelligence on-chain, more dynamic and actionable operations are enabled. For example, a secure smart contract may choose to differentiate its actions when interaction with secure and non-secure smart contracts; in real life, this differentiation is analogous to lenders who charge different rates based on a person&#x27;s credit score (or in this case, security score).</p><p id="1635dc2a-81d0-4cdc-b1b6-5c8e43c1d171" class="">The CVM exposes smart contract and blockchain security information to VM code, enabling unprecedented ways to access, check, depend on, and even dynamically establish blockchain and smart contract security. On-chain security intelligence provides access to information for better decision-making. While unaudited/unverified smart contracts may still execute in the CVM, there is higher transparency to those seeking to interact with it.</p><p id="d2ffb374-1b6b-471c-8ec0-dc20fe05a76d" class="">A long-term goal for CVM is the separation of chain state access and general computation. VMs stand in between the smart contract/plugin/dApp logic and the persistent chain state access/replication logic. Many of today&#x27;s VMs, including Ethereum&#x27;s EVM, handle both blockchain state access and general computation in the same way, with no separation between VM instructions and smart contract language features. This structure loses out on the many good ways to write, debug, and run general computations that have already existed before blockchain. While some chains / VMs try to use libraries instead for chain state access, but that doesn&#x27;t fix the problem because it comes with its problems, such as language-dependency, API inconsistency, and still no isolation between general computation and state access. To remedy these issues, the CVM will use the leading universal VM, the x86-64 OS process model, while potentially expanding to other ISAs such as arm64 in the future. Blockchain state access will be provided as OS abstractions (memory page, files, signals, procfs, syscalls, etc.) to CVM code. Existing bytecode VMs will still be fully supported and actually become middleware between their VM code and the CVM, meaning that the CVM will be language agnostic. As a result, all existing tooling—whether designed for the blockchain world or not—will be reusable for CVM code development. This OS process model also provides an excellent abstraction level for CVM code protection and isolations.</p><p id="d1bcab76-a7cd-4484-879e-306c860e1810" class="">

A proof object is any kind of machine-readable representation of a proof which can be independently checked to establish that a theorem is true. Currently the most commonly used form are the .vo files produced be the Coq proof assistant: they contain only the logical inferences used to prove a theorem, but omit the tactics and proof search which was used to construct it, so they can be checked by a utility program which is simpler and more trustworthy than the full Coq system.</p><p id="7ca7e9e8-62bb-4fdf-a3c5-8ed0d19b51e2" class="">Proof objects are naturally trust-less, but with the current state of the art the only way to check a proof is to run the checker yourself. With the CertiK Chain, users have a decentralized way to confirm that a proof object is valid. The user will compile the proof using Coq, preprocess .vo files with a CertiK-developed tool, and submit it to a set of proof-validating nodes. If enough nodes agree that the proof is valid, it will be added to the chain state.

Similar to certificates, the CVM lets user contracts query this database, so it is possible to make decentralized decisions using proofs, for example, upgrading a contract only if the upgraded version comes with a correctness proof, or posting a bounty for a theorem to be proven.</p><p id="b28477dc-c004-41b7-8ef1-76ec6437f2e5" class="">

DeepSEA is a secure programming language and compiler toolchain developed by researchers from CertiK, Yale University, and Columbia University to allow secure smart contract development, providing a way to formally verify difficult correctness properties about smart contracts using the Coq proof assistant. DeepSEA has the potential to eliminate some of the most critical, yet avoidable source code flaws, and its development has been supported by research grants from the<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-foundation-funds-columbia-yale-researchers-work-on-smart-contract-language"> Ethereum Foundation</a>,<a href="https://www.datascience.columbia.edu/columbia-ibm-center-supports-breakthrough-research-blockchain-technology"> Columbia-IBM</a>, and the<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/qtum-awards-400k-grant-to-columbia-university-research-team-for-smart-contracts-rd"> Qtum Foundation</a>.</p><p id="a9e2c15d-e8da-49cc-a8fd-7b64191a6d5d" class="">Much existing work on smart contract verification is built around automatic theorem provers such as Z3. These provers provide convenience by simply requiring a developer to state a theorem and then program attempts to prove that it holds true. However, they are most useful for relatively simple proofs about e.g. arithmetic expressions and data structures like arrays. In cases where the theorem requires creativity or requires custom definitions to even state (such as many of the complex requirements in smart contracts), automatic tools tend to get stuck. Coq is an example of an interactive proof assistant, which means that it doesn’t prove the theorems for users: instead, the user must write both the theorem statement and the proof, and Coq checks whether the proof is correct or not. While this involves more work, it permits arbitrarily advanced mathematics.</p><p id="6370b265-42c3-43ec-8958-d572dfcae214" class="">To reason about a contract in Coq, we first need to define a model of what it is doing, then load it into the Coq proof assistant. To achieve this securely, contracts are written in the fairly small programming language of DeepSEA. The DeepSEA compiler both compiles the contract into CVM bytecode and also outputs the representation that can be loaded into Coq. This allows the reasoning of a convenient, high-level representation of the contract, and because the DeepSEA compiler has been fully verified to be correct, the generated Coq contract representation is ensured to match the compiled CVM bytecode execution.</p><figure id="3e9b4ea3-3cd6-4d35-826f-1c3b67d84fc6" class="image"><a href="CertiKChain%20Whitepaper%20staging%20519909e582d14ee8b7c4c48ff8fd5294/DeepSEA_(1).jpg"><img style="width:10497px" src="CertiKChain%20Whitepaper%20staging%20519909e582d14ee8b7c4c48ff8fd5294/DeepSEA_(1).jpg"/></a></figure><p id="42e7af23-b1ef-4d4d-a26d-aec0afe4e002" class="">

On the one hand, in order to be easy to formally reason about, programs should be as high-level as possible, ideally pure functional programs operating on high-level data types like unbounded numbers and lists. On the other hand, executing blockchain contracts is expensive, so we cannot afford luxuries like big integers or a garbage collector. The DeepSEA approach to this problem was informed by the experience of verifying the CertiKOS kernel. We provide a small language that avoids features that are hard to reason about, but at the same time can be executed without an elaborate runtime system.</p><p id="3de17b9f-7949-47c8-b37f-1ad77ce2cd0d" class="">A DeepSEA program consists of a set of <em>objects</em>, and each of the objects has a set of <em>fields</em> and <em>methods</em>. In the CVM case, these correspond to contracts, storage, and methods. In this way we ensure that all contract data is encapsulated behind the object interfaces, so each method can update fields but otherwise behaves like a function. Similar to e.g. Facebook’s Move language there is no way to pass around pointers to the “inside” of an object, so proofs don’t have to worry about aliasing and frame rules, although the implementation may use pointers to big data as an optimization hidden from the programmer. Therefore, the meaning of a DeepSEAprogram can be modeled as a set of pure functions that can be reasoned about equationally (like in high-school algebra) inside a proof assistant.</p><p id="352ebec5-9f24-4e76-bffe-0d7f00e6856f" class="">A set of objects can be gathered into a <em>layer</em>, which represents a coherent view of the entire contract state. Finally, the language supports <em>abstract refinement</em> of layers, where the programmer manually writes a specification for some methods and provides a proof that it’s satisfied. For example, one can implement a tree data structure in terms of arrays and indices, and then abstractly refine it into a simple tree data type like you might write it in a functional programming language.</p><p id="83dad09b-8de4-4473-9611-5e279184a50a" class="">As a representative example, the following is an excerpt from a contract implementing a second-price blind auction.

The type-annotated abstract syntax tree of the core term is printed out into a Coq source file, and then the middle-end produces both the C implementation and the functional specification from that representation. The front-end also translates layer calculus expressions from the DeepSEA source file into calls to the various lemmas of the Certified Abstraction Layers library—composing specifications and proofs for individual methods into a specification and proof for the entire system.</p><p id="416b10b6-2370-41a4-a4a1-fec4e8f5518f" class="">To be precise, the language that the middle-end targets are a subset of C, which we refer to as “MiniC”. The bulk of the middle-end implementation consists of a theorem, proven in Coq, that the command translation is correct with respect to the desugaring. The correctness theorem is proven once and for all. Then each time the user compiles a DeepSEA program, the front-end generates a set of Coq files which apply the desugaring and program extraction functions, and the compilation correctness theorem, to the intermediate representation of that input program. The end result is a proof that the generated functional specification matches the extracted C code. The user can load those files into Coq, and compose that proof with manually written proofs about the functional specifications.</p><p id="2e217238-db54-421c-9a56-0938b7263c74" class="">

In other words, it forms a replacement for a C compiler when targeting a blockchain target like CVM or WebAssembly instead of x86 assembly. The verified part of the backend produces CVM assembly code, then an untrusted assembler/pretty-printer converts identifiers to integer offsets (for jump labels, storage identifiers, and method entry points), and outputs bytes.</p><p id="d2f93de0-8461-43b5-b468-6e523c95e4e9" class="">The backend proof takes the form of a number of lemmas, each saying that the translated program is equivalent to the source program. For example, the backend first transfers MiniC programs into a language, called Clike, which expands “complex” values (e.g., a hashtable) into storage and pointers. As for the function clike_rvalue translating MiniC expressions to Clike expressions, we prove a lemma</p><pre id="c474d00c-290e-4ffc-a0d2-c87b2bbd46a9" class="code code-wrap"><code>Lemma rvalue_equiv: forall (eMiniC eClike: expr) (result: val) (id: ident_ext),

We have to define what it means for a State in the abstract syntax tree of miniC to be equivalent to a State in the control flow graph of Clike. Each compilation phase defines such a relation, e.g.</p><pre id="45764602-48bc-4249-b1bb-fb7fe191aac6" class="code code-wrap"><code>Inductive match_states: state -&gt; state -&gt; Prop :=

It is written in C and formally verified using the Coq interactive proof assistant. In 2015-2020 it has been the subject of five papers published at<a href="https://dl.acm.org/action/doSearch?AllField=certikos"> top computer science conferences</a>. In order to attain the vision of end-to-end security throughout the tech stack, CertiK has adapted CertiKOS to serve as a bedrock for the security infrastructure of CertiK Chain. CertiKOS will play a pivotal role in running CertiK Chain nodes and porting security primitives from the CertiK Security Oracle.</p><p id="d08c3f03-9caf-4f03-a0f0-6c826d8085ac" class="">A promise of blockchain is to remove single points of trust. At an architectural level, this is achieved by having mining nodes owned by different people in different locations using different set-ups. At the operating system level, however, there is a striking monoculture, as the vast majority of nodes run on Linux, often in a cloud computing environment like AWS or Google Cloud.</p><p id="89dae7bd-9fea-478d-bc2d-21fd8a7d9447" class="">This identifies a fundamental problem. Because Linux consists of 27 million lines of C code, it is virtually impossible to ensure that it is free of critical security bugs. According to the CVE vulnerability database, 347 security problems in the Linux kernel were discovered during 2018-2019, and 14 of which were of “critical” severity. Furthermore, the runtime environment of such a computer also includes a large runtime system (e.g. the standard C library) which itself may contain vulnerabilities. Additionally, if the system also runs on a cloud computer, there&#x27;s another dependency on the reliability of the underlying hypervisor.</p><p id="d6f15ab2-fd9e-4764-9a0a-704b1efbf842" class="">A similar problem affects oracle systems, as oracles are computers that feed raw data (such as currency exchange rates) to smart contracts. They need to be trustworthy and often use mechanisms like SGX enclaves or voting among a set of computers, but a vulnerability at the OS level could compromise the entire set of oracle computers at once.</p><p id="893d1093-44bf-4cb1-b67c-0d4a60bad2b5" class="">

It is responsible for controlling access to hardware devices and data files, and to prevent programs from interfering with memory used by other programs, so a bug in the kernel can let a hacker take complete control of the entire computer and bypass all security guarantees of the programs running on it. Furthermore, all programs running on a computer will use services provided by the operating system, so in order to formally verify the application programs one needs a formal specification of what the operating system is doing. If the operating system itself is not verified, then that specification might not correspond to what the OS is actually doing, so even if the kernel itself is not buggy subsequent verification efforts may be invalid because the application programmer misunderstood what specification the OS was supposed to follow.</p><p id="44c59d32-31bf-471f-9380-9966621b828a" class="">In CertiKOS that cannot happen, because the operating system comes with a formal specification written in Coq which says <em>exactly</em> what each call to OS should do, and a formal proof that the C code follows the specification. This proof already implies that the code does not have any of the errors that typically leads to security vulnerabilities; for example it has no buffer overflows, no memory leaks or non-termination, no NULL pointer access or ill-typed pointer access, no arithmetic exceptions, etc. Furthermore, we have used the high-level specification to prove that the kernel satisfies a “non-interference” security property: if you configure CertiKOS to put two programs into separate compartments, there is no way for any information to leak from one compartment to the other. And finally, the high-level specification can be used to prove that application programs running on top of CertiKOS are correct. So the verified kernel lays the foundation for a complete verified software stack.</p><p id="f446476d-0474-46ef-b75b-cca05c13f9ce" class="">The current version of CertiKOS is much smaller and provides fewer features than mainstream kernels such as Linux. It consists of about 11,000 lines of code, and it implements memory management, multithreading, and a few device drivers. On the other hand, it currently lacks e.g. a file system or a network stack. The feature set implemented by CertiKOS is similar to what a hypervisor or a microkernel provides, and it can be used to run a hypervisor, which can then run e.g. a Linux system inside a secure compartment. In the DARPA-sponsored HACMS program, CertiKOS was used as a hypervisor to host the software of a robotic land vehicle, ensuring e.g. that even if a hacker broke into the radar software compartment, they still would not be able to influence the guidance software. And CertiK is currently using CertiKOS as a hypervisor hosting nodes for the CertiK chain.</p><figure id="0a2c304f-e226-4841-b46d-e856dd8c045c" class="image"><a href="CertiKChain%20Whitepaper%20staging%20519909e582d14ee8b7c4c48ff8fd5294/sysarch.png"><img style="width:1136px" src="CertiKChain%20Whitepaper%20staging%20519909e582d14ee8b7c4c48ff8fd5294/sysarch.png"/></a></figure><p id="a5c5d55b-cd04-44ee-b44e-2a21b0604089" class="">(Components of the CertiKOS kernel)</p><p id="aa8348dd-c0f3-4e73-abaa-fc52848468ad" class="">The research emphasis in the CertiKOS project has been on finding a way to formally verify such a large program without excessive labor, resulting in a novel approach which we call <em>Concurrent Certified Abstraction Layers</em> (CCAL). By dividing the kernel into multiple layers that each provide a self-contained abstraction, we were able to verify a concurrent OS kernel with fine-grained locking, a world’s first. The layered approach also sets CertiKOS apart from microkernel projects: although the current feature set is limited, the intention is to keep extending it by adding more layers.

First, entirely new modules must be integrated, such as a filesystem and a network stack, and hardware driver for the new computer hardware. Second, in order to run software written for Linux with minimal modifications, a compatibility layer must be added to export the API that those programs expect. For example, CertiKOS already has system calls for creating threads or waiting on condition variables, but a new set of system calls needs to be added with names and parameters corresponding to the Linux interface.</p><p id="73a24b5c-1e78-4ada-9c5e-5bb395141071" class="">In a major milestone, CertiKOS ran a Coq-certifying primitive, which accepts Coq source files, runs the Coq proof checker, and replies with a cryptographically signed certificate that the purported proofs are indeed valid.</p><p id="a092889f-7768-4216-94d5-382fd3db953a" class="">

The recipient of the tokens could be a chain user who has done—or plans to do—development work or security work for the chain. The recipient could also be a smart contract that distributes the tokens to multiple addresses after conditions have been met. For example, a bug bounty smart contract could be funded by a community pool spend proposal. When a user finds a bug, the owner of the smart contract could send some tokens to that user as a reward.

Reward rates and the token minting/burning process are discussed in the next section.</p><p id="320c70ac-adb4-4830-bc21-f175d8413f9e" class="">Validators, since they are part of the Tendermint consensus algorithm, can be punished if they make infractions either deliberately or unknowingly. There are only two cases where the staked CTK is slashed: double signing and being offline. A bonded validator is &quot;being offline&quot; if it does not participate in the consensus protocol for more than a certain time. The validator enters the tombstone state after the slashing, where it cannot get slashed until it un-jails himself.</p><p id="582eec68-0a89-401e-9dc2-f1acac86f35e" class="">Validators may unbond their staked tokens. The validator will go through a 14-day period in which the tokens are locked. In the case of a validator unbonding, the delegators of the validator may choose to re-delegate to other validators to continue earning staking rewards. Otherwise, the delegators will not be able to earn further rewards, as the original unbonded validator is effectively excluded from the validator set.</p><p id="0ba6db27-4e54-4283-a25f-94754b3fe659" class="">Listed below are important parameters for rewards and punishments.</p><ol id="1684ab3c-4a25-46e4-89ea-f7daad646d9d" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>Proposer reward: 5%</li></ol><ol id="02b8b1d4-8155-4b1f-9eee-5349407eeb52" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li>Double Sign slashing: 5%</li></ol><ol id="32ca1bb9-bfcc-4d70-a573-8a3dd5d5b8de" class="numbered-list" start="3"><li>Downtime slashing: 1%</li></ol><ol id="75a64ba3-4ca9-45e5-8677-b80ca6ac7568" class="numbered-list" start="4"><li>Downtime Threshold: 600000000000ns (10 minutes)</li></ol><h2 id="c3b00d8e-f637-4aed-ad4b-29d974b80db9" class=""><strong>5.2 Inflation</strong></h2><p id="575e10fe-5871-40c1-aed0-05b2353d96b7" class="">The default annual rewards rate of the staked coins is 7%.

However, we also want to encourage users to make use of the CertiK Virtual Machine. To balance the two, the CertiK Chain has a target staked ratio of 66.7%. Whenever the staked ratio falls below the target staked ratio, the rewards rate goes up Also, whenever the staked ratio rises above the target staked ratio, the rewards rate falls. This is to encourage/discourage staking in order to balance between security and liquidity of the chain.</p><p id="3ad25462-1049-42d3-9fc7-1e34ef064d9d" class="">Listed below are important parameters for rewards:</p><ol id="fdcf8373-ef4d-4064-b0a1-1a441e86b21f" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>Initial inflation (interest) rate: 7%</li></ol><ol id="fe27a397-42e3-4ff5-acff-ca0f02d1091e" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li>Minimum inflation rate: 4%</li></ol><ol id="ee550146-a959-4c79-a14f-d784f2026903" class="numbered-list" start="3"><li>Maximum inflation rate: 14%</li></ol><ol id="c258ef60-84ee-4488-a379-6455994d195a" class="numbered-list" start="4"><li>Yearly maximum inflation rate change: 14%</li></ol><ol id="ba698f70-70e9-4c51-a06f-ab16a7baa1c3" class="numbered-list" start="5"><li>Target staked ratio: 66.7%</li></ol><h1 id="29fa457b-6317-408f-a0e5-d6e40efcd1fb" class=""><strong>6 Roadmap</strong></h1><p id="7ce4b6cf-e468-4190-964e-270edf5a4570" class="">The core pillars of the CertiK ecosystem consists of several components, each independent and complex, yet interconnected and vital to achieving the mission of empowering people to trust in the blockchain. These components are broken down below, along with high-level milestones for each stage of development. With the mainnet launch, all necessary functionalities have been fully built, developed and ready for usage.
